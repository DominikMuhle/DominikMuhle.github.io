description: "AnyCam is a fast transformer model that directly estimates camera poses and intrinsics from a dynamic video sequence in feed-forward fashion. This network can learn strong priors over realistic camera motion, by training on diverse, unlabelled video datasets obtained mostly from YouTube."
