description: "SkeletonDiffusion is a novel nonisotropic diffusion approach for 3D Human Motion Prediction, and the first computer vision method to show that nonisotropic diffusion leads to unequivocally better performance without computational drawbacks for a structured task. We generate diverse and realistic motions achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and AMASS datasets."
